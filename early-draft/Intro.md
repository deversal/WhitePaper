#Introduction 

In the last few years the number of internet connected appliances and devices have increased dramatically. Under the promise of a seamless world of tomorrow where devices interact in an autonomous way , consumers have not only accept but to also expect their non-computing devices to be Internet connected. The early devices rely heavily on proprietary APIs and often lack a way to communicate with other manufacturer’s devices. Deversal is a set of standards and tools that help create a universal API for smart devices in an easy to develop and secure way that provides a seamless experience for end users. 



#What is a non-computing smart devices? 

A non-computing smart device is a term used to describe devices that historically were in widespread use prior to the Internet and did not originally rely Internet connectivity. It is a sub-set of the now commonly used term smart devices. These devices are usually created to solve a specific problem and are very simple in terms of mechanics. Common examples include, Door locks, Lightbulbs, Refrigerators, toasters etc... 






#Why is Deversal Important ? 


In today’s inter-connected world a kid in Japan can chat in real-time with a kid in the U.S. without knowing his language. He is able to do this using a translation application.  In an inter-connected world your coffee machine might speak the samsung language and your door might speak the Microsoft language. Deversal brings a universal language that all devices can speak. Both device to device and device to user communication 

This allows for a single identity management for users. A user is able to rent a vehicle and then pay for their autonomous parking meter with the same account, all by simply scanning a qr code.


#Sharing economy 


The sharing economy refers to the new business models where the concept of full ownership is lost to the newer model of community owned objects that are then rented out by members of that community. 

To be a truly disruptive force, the sharing economy needs to be seamless. All devices must list on the same universal network and users must be able to authenticate. The current model of smart devices require a new identity to be registered with each individual device by a device owner. These devices commonly rely on central systems that act as a central point of failure and is susceptible to security vulnerabilities. 


Deversal devices are not internet-facing. They communicate solely through the Ethereum network. They accomplish this by using a Deversal bridge. The Deversal bridge is a proxy that allows reading and writing to the Ethereum network in a standerdized way with easy to follow APIs that allows developers to build smart devices without needing to be an expert in Ethereum. 




#Developers, Developers, Developers 


Deversal focuses on developer support by building standards and tools that help those building next-gen IoT devices to quickly build and deploy. The Deversal bridge handles all communications to the Ethereum network. Deversal libraries are available in multiple languages and enable developers to code their projects without requiring an immerse knowledge of Ethereum internals.
